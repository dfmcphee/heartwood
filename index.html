					<h2 class="heading">Our story</h2>
					<p class="">The Heartwood is run by two sisters from the Ottawa Valley. They share a vision for a place for all of the things they love — gathering people together, sharing good music, and serving delicious food.</p>
					<p>The name Heartwood is an homage to their late father, Donald McPhee. Heartwood Guitars was his business in Rockingham where he worked as a luthier. The restaurant is named in his memory to honour not just to his craft and creativity but also his entrepreneurial spark.</p>
